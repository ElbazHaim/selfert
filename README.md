In class we briefly discussed the negative consqeunces of inbreeding in regard to lethal mutations and alleles. Self fertilization ('selfing') is essentially the most extreme form of inbreeding.
 Intuitively, it seems that self fertilization cannot increase the mean fitness of a population. However, self fertilization is relatively abundant in plants, especially in crop & model plants. In these species, some part of the population reproduces by self fertilization as opposed to out-crossing. 
 
 How is that the case? Why was self-fertilization not lost during the evolution of these species? 
 Can it help favoring a genotype that otherwise would not be in favor?
 
 In other words - what is the relationship between natural selection and self fertilization?
